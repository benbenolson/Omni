This code implements omni device support without compiling the devices.
It will read any omni XML file for a printer (master file), any other
supporting XML files for that printer (like for forms or trays) and
act like the compiled device (ex libEpson_Stylus_Color_760.so).
This support is called XMLDevice support.

This documents what you need to do to install and use XMLDevice support.
   - configure and compile the omni driver for XMLDevice support.
       ./setupOmni --enable-devicexml
   - install the compiled omni driver.
       make install

New installed directory structure:
   /opt/Omni/bin   is unchanged
   /opt/Omni/lib   only needs libomni.so variants and libXMLOmniDevice.so variants
                   from the existing build.  The other pre-existing libraries do not
                   hurt to be left there.  It adds libraries for the indivdual device
                   instances and blitters. (ex libEpson_High_Res_ESCP2_Instance.so)
   /opt/Omni/data  is new and contains all of the device XML files.
                   (ex "Epson Stylus Color 760.xml")

New manditory job properties for XMLDevice support:
   the key 'XMLMasterFile' is always required for a print job.  Its value is the
   name of the root or master XML file for a device
   (ex: '"Epson Stylus Color 760.xml"').  The quotes are necessary because the
   XML files always have spaces in them.  So, you must always add the following
   to the job properties that you use in a print job.
      XMLMasterFile="Epson Stylus Color 760.xml"
