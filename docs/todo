- Additional clean up of code

- Fix all color dithering algorithms to use a consistent color space
  conversion.

- Add device specific color dithering algorithms.

- Implement Ghostscript banding in the Ghostscript render and out of
  core Omni.

- performance improvements

- Add support for additional input bitmap support. Currently there
  is only support for mono and 24bpp output.

- Copies function to be added

- Stucki Diffusion (default dither) provides the best quality output at
  this point in time.  Using a high quality coated paper should be used
  when printing high quality image output.

    Some of the other dithering code that needs completion are:
           Steinberg
           Level
           Smooth
           HSV
           Ordered Square
           Void Cluster
