We have not verified the color correctness on every device.  If you find
that the color output on your device is not correct, The color output can
be adjusted by changing each of the gammas in the gamma file for the
particular device you are using.  Before you can change the correct gamma
you must first be able to identify each of the following:

     - printer model

     - type of dither method applied - matrix or diffusion

     - printing mode, be it mono, 8, or 24 bit black/black and color

     - media type

If you are working with the Epson Stylus Color 860 you can change the file
"Epson Stylus 860 Gammas".  The structure defining each of the values in
the file are contained in DeviceGammas.hpp.  The gamma value can be changed
along with the bias value, minimum value needed for each color.  Raising
any of these values will deplete the color that has been changed. Since the
Omni driver supports separate per color plane corrections for each media type,
print mode, resolution, and dither mode combination you must modify the line
representing your current print options.
