Pre-requisites:
---------------
 1. Gtk-- ( GTK minus minus) 1.2.x installed.
     You can download this at http://gtkmm.sourceforge.net/download.html
     (This needs SigC++ in turn).
 2. Make sure that gtk-- is properly installed by running a sample program provided with gtk--.
 
Instructions to use:
--------------------
 1. untar the file JobDialog.tar in a new directory.
 2. You can run make in two ways.
	a)"make libobj" 
		This compiles all the CPP files and the C wrapper code. All the .o files are then archived into .a file called "libjobdialog.a". The client of JobDialog can then use -ljobdialog option while linking. 
 	
	b) "make exe"  which creates a Test-stub.
		 Run the executable from the prompt as:  " ./OmniTest ". 
        	This will output on the console the various job Properties.
